  heroDescription:
    "The Turning Tides Project is dedicated to supporting and empowering carers by providing them with the tools, inspiration, and community they need to maintain their well-being while caring for others. We believe in the importance of reclaiming one’s life, fostering personal growth, and nurturing happiness even in the most challenging caregiving roles.",

  whyParagraphs: [
    "The Turning Tides Project was created to shine a light on unpaid carers and the incredible work they do. Caring for someone you love should not leave you feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, or lost. We offer practical tools and guidance to help carers clear the mental load, protect their energy, and feel more like themselves again while continuing to care.",
    "For many carers, life can feel like a tide that never stops coming in. Responsibilities, worry, decisions, and emotional weight can arrive wave after wave, day after day.",
    "Turning the tide does not mean the caring ends. It means you no longer feel pulled under by the weight of it all and, most importantly, you begin to feel like yourself again.",
    "The Turning Tides Project exists to help create that shift.",
